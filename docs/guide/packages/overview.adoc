## Feature-pack packages

Package is a minimal atomic unit of a feature-pack that can be included into or excluded from the installation. It could be a set of files and/or provisioning resources used by the provisioning tool to install the package.

Essentially, a software release is a set of packages released under a common version.

Package contains:

*   metadata describing the package;

*   _(optional)_ content which is added to the installation when the package is installed;

*   _(optional)_ other resources that are used during provisioning to integrate the content (or what the package represents) properly into the target installation.

Package may declare dependencies on other packages that belong to the same or another feature-pack. Before a package is installed, the tool will make sure all its dependencies are satisifed (installing the missing ones).

Package is identified by its name. The name must be unique in the feature-pack the package belongs to.

Packages are not versioned. Only the feature-pack has a version.
