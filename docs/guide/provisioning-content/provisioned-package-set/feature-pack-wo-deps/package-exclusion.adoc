##### Explicit package exclusion

A package may be explicitly excluded from the feature-pack's effective package set. For example, given the following feature-pack definition:

[options="nowrap"]
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
                groupId="org.jboss.fp.group1" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0" >
    <default-packages>
        <package name="p1" />
        <package name="p2" />
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>

and assuming that

*   package *p1* has an optional dependency on non-default package *p11*

*   package *p2* has an optional dependency on non-default package *p22*  

The original effective package set of *fp1* includes *p1*, *p11*, *p2* and *p22*.

If a user is interested in a subset of the effective package set, in fact, only in package *p1*, for example, it can be expressed in the provisioning XML configuration file as

[options="nowrap"]
 <feature-pack groupId="org.jboss.group1" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0">
    <packages>
        <exclude name="p11"/>
        <exclude name="p2"/>
    </packages>
 </feature-pack>

Packages *p11* and *p2* are explicitly excluded and package *p22* is a non-default package which is not on the dependency tree originating from the packages to be installed, i.e. *p1*.
