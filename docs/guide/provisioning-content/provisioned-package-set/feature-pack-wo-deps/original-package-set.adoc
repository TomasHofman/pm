##### Feature-pack original effective package set

_Original_ in the title means not explicitly modified. I.e. a set of packages which is going to be installed when a feature-pack is installed as-is without any user customization.

The feature-pack's original effective package set consists of all the default packages of the feature-pack plus all the packages from the package dependency trees originating from the default packages.
