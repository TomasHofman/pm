#### Feature-pack with dependencies

Feature pack may depend on one or more other feature-packs. Feature-pack dependencies are expressed in the feature-pack metadata, i.e. the *feature-pack.xml* file. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
                groupId="org.jboss.fp.group1" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0" >
    <dependencies>
        <dependency groupId="org.jboss.dep.group1" artifactId="fp2" version="0.0.1"/>
        <dependency groupId="org.jboss.dep.group2" artifactId="fp3" version="0.0.2"/>
    </dependencies>
    <default-packages>
        <package name="package1"/>
        <package name="package2"/>
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>
----

In this case feature-pack *fp1* depends on feature-packs *fp2* and *fp3*. Let's also assume that *fp3* depends on feature-pack *fp4* and *fp2* and *fp4* donâ€™t have any further dependencies. The effective package set of feature-pack *fp1* will consist of:

*   the original effective package set of *fp1*;

*   the original effective package set of *fp2*;

*   the original effective package set of *fp3*;

*   the original effective package set of *fp4*.
