#### Package dependencies

Package dependency may be required or optional.

*Required dependency* means that a package cannot be installed unless all its required dependencies are satisfied, i.e. installed. If any required dependency cannot be satisfied (perhaps because a package that happens to be a required dependency has been explicitly excluded from the installation), the provisioning process will fail with an error.

*Optional dependency* means that the dependency does not have to be satisfied for the package to be installed. For example if package *p1* declares an optional dependency on package *p2* and *p2* is explicitly excluded by the user, *p1* will still be installed. An example of an optional dependency could be a package called *documentation* which declares an optional dependency on package *examples*. If a user is not interested in the *examples*, the rest of the *documentation* could still be installed.

Package dependencies are also used to determine the <<_feature_pack_without_dependencies,effective package set of a feature-pack>> to be installed described later.

#### Local package dependencies

If a package depends on another package from the same feature-pack, the dependency is called a local package dependency. Here is an example of how local dependencies are expressed in the XML metadata:

[options="nowrap"]
 <package-spec xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-package:1.0" name="p1">
    <dependencies>
        <package name="p2"/>
        <package name="p3" optional=”true”/>
    </dependencies>
 </package-spec>

In this example *p2* is a required dependency of *p1* while *p3* is an optional one.

#### External package dependencies

If a package depends on a package from another feature-pack, the dependency is called an external package dependency.

Although a package may declare a dependency on a package from another feature-pack, it cannot specify the version of the feature-pack in the package dependency declaration.

Feature-pack containing a package with an external dependency must declare an explicit dependency on the feature-pack (specifying its version) the target package of the external dependency belongs to. This feature-pack dependency must also be assigned a name which will be used as a reference to the that dependency in the *package.xml* file where the external package dependency is declared.

For example, suppose feature-pack *fp1* depends on feature-pack *fp2* and package *fp1:p1* depends on packages *fp2:p1* and *fp2:p10*. The *feature-pack.xml* of *fp1* might look like this:

[options="nowrap"]
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
                groupId="org.jboss.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0">
    <dependencies>
        <dependency groupId="org.jboss.pm.test" artifactId="fp2" version="2.0.0">
            <name>fp2-dep</name>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <default-packages>
        <package name="p1"/>
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>

And the *package.xml* file of *fp1:p1* might look like this:

[options="nowrap"]
 <package-spec xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-package:1.0" name="p1">
    <dependencies>
        <package name="p2" />
        <feature-pack dependency=”fp2-dep”>
            <package name=”p1” />
            <package name=”p10” />
        </feature-pack>
        <package name="p3" />
    </dependencies>
 </package-spec>
