### Feature-pack metadata (feature-pack.xml)

Feature-pack metadata contains the following information:

* *GAV* - feature-pack groupId, artifactId and version;

* *default packages* - the names of the packages that are installed by default;

* _(optional)_ *dependencies* -  dependencies on other feature-packs;

* _(optional)_ *provisioning plug-ins* - provisioning plug-in implementations the tool should call during provisioning to properly install/integrate the feature-pack's content into the target installation.

Here is an illustration of how it may look like in a feature-pack.xml file:

[options="nowrap"]
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
                groupId="org.my-group"
                artifactId="my-artifact"
                version="1.0.0.Alpha1">
    <dependencies>
        <dependency groupId="org.another-group"
                    artifactId="another-artifact"
                    version="3.0.0.Final"/>
    </dependencies>
    <default-packages>
        <package name="package1"/>
        <package name="package2"/>
    </default-packages>
    <provisioning-plugins>
        <artifact coords="org.my-group:my-provisioning-plugin:2.0.0.Beta2"/>
    </provisioning-plugins>
 </feature-pack>

Here feature-pack *org.my-group:my-artifact:1.0.0.Alpha1* depends on feature-pack *org.another-group:another-artifact:3.0.0.Final* and has packages *package1* and *package2* that are installed by default.
It also references a provisioning plug-in which is available as a Maven artifact which will be resolved, downloaded and called by the provisioning tool to give it a chance to do some final content manipulations before the provisioning is complete.
