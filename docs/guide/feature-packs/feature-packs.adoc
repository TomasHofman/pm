## Feature-packs

Feature-pack represents a released unit of software that can be installed or uninstalled using the provisioning tool. Feature-packs are Maven artifacts identified by GAV (groupId, artifactId and version).

Feature-pack contains:

* metadata describing the feature-pack;

* a set of packages;

* _(optional)_ various resources required to properly assemble and setup the installation;

* _(optional)_ custom provisioning plug-ins.


Feature-pack may declare dependencies on other feature-packs. Before a feature-pack is installed the tool will make sure its dependencies are satisifed (installing the missing ones).

Conceptutally, any software installation can be described as one or more feature-packs installed at a specific location.
