##### Including features and feature groups from other feature-packs

Feature groups, as well as *config* elements in the *feature-pack.xml*, may include features and feature groups from other feature-packs. This is done by including one or more `feature-pack` element and specifying the origin of the included features and feature groups in its `dependency` attribute. For example

[source,xml]
----
<feature-group-spec name="group1" xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-group:1.0">

  <feature spec="feature1">
    <param name="id" value="a1"/>
  </feature>

  <feature-pack dependency="another-feature-pack">
    <feature-group name="group2"/>
    <feature spec="feature2">
      <param name="id" value="b1"/>
    </feature>
  </feature-pack>

  <feature-group name="group3"/>

  <feature-pack dependency="another-feature-pack">
    <feature-group name="group3"/>
  </feature-pack>

</feature-group-spec>
----

In this case, the order of the features in the resolved feature group will be

. _feature1:id=a1_ from the local feature-pack;

. features from _group2_ from *another-feature-pack*;

. _feature2:id=b1_ from *another-feature-pack*;

. features from _group3_ from the local feature-pack;

. features from _group3_ from *another-feature-pack*.
