###### Excluding features from a group by specs

[[fg-exclude-features-by-specs]]When a feature group is included into another group or a config, all the features of a specific feature spec can be excluded from the included feature set by simply specifying the feature spec.


Suppose, we have the following group spec:
[source,xml]
----
<feature-group-spec name="group1" xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-group:1.0">

  <feature spec="feature1">
    <param name="id" value="a1"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature1">
    <param name="id" value="a2"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature2">
    <param name="id" value="b1"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature2">
    <param name="id" value="b2"/>
  </feature>


</feature-group-spec>
----

Here is how all the feature of the *feature1* spec can be excluded:
[source,xml]
----
<config>
  <feature-group name="group1">
    <exclude spec="feature1"/>
  </feature-group>
</config>
----

The config will include *feature2:id=b1* and *feature2:id=b2*.
