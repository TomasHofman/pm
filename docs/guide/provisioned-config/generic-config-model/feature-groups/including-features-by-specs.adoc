###### Including features of specific feature specs from a group

[[fg-include-features-by-specs]]When a feature group is included into another group or a config, by default all the features it contains are included but it is also possible to pick features of which feature specs should be included.

Suppose, we have the following group spec:
[source,xml]
----
<feature-group-spec name="group1" xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-group:1.0">

  <feature spec="feature1">
    <param name="id" value="a1"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature1">
    <param name="id" value="a2"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature2">
    <param name="id" value="b1"/>
  </feature>
  <feature spec="feature2">
    <param name="id" value="b2"/>
  </feature>


</feature-group-spec>
----

Here is how all the features of *feature1* can be included into the config:
[source,xml]
----
<config>
  <feature-group name="group1" inherit-features="false">
    <include spec="feature1"/>
  </feature-group>
</config>
----

NOTE: `inherit-features` attribute indicates whether the whole feature set of the group should be included into the config or not. If this attribute is not specified, its value is assumed to be true.

Then the `include` element is specifying the feature spec features of which should be included into the config.

The config will include *feature1:id=a1* and *feature1:id=a2*.

NOTE: `<exclude feature-id="xxx"/>` elements can be used to exclude certain features from the feature set of the included feature spec.
