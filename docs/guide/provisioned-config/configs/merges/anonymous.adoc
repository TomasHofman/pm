#### Anonymous config

Anonymous config is associated with neither name nor model. E.g.

[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
              groupId="org.jboss.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0">
  <config>
    <!-- config body -->
  </config>
</feature-pack>
----

One of the limitations of the anonymous configs is that it cannot be customized. It can only be provisioned as it was defined in the feature-pack spec.
