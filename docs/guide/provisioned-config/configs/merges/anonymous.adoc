#### Anonymous configs

Anonymous configs are associated with neither name nor model. E.g.

[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
              groupId="org.jboss.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0">
  <config>
    <!-- config body -->
  </config>
</feature-pack>
----

That means anonymous configs have no identity. They cannot be customized and they are not merged. Each anonymous config is a standalone config.
