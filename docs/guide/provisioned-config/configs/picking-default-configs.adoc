### Picking default configs into the installation

There are two scenarios when including a config makes sense:

. when the config was excluded by `<exclude model="_model_name_"/>`;

. when inhertance of the default configs was disabled with `<default-configs inherit="false">`.

The first one of course assumes that the config is associated with both the name and the model. It could look like this
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack groupId="org.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs>
        <exclude model="model1"/>
        <include name="config1" model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

The example above excludes all the configs with the *model1* except the *config1*.

Here is an example for the second scenario
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack groupId="org.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs inherit="false">
        <include name="config1"/>
        <include name="config1" model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

The example above picks only the *config1* and the *model1:config1* from all the default configs to be included into the installation.

It also possible to include the configs of a specific model, e.g.
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack groupId="org.pm.test" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs inherit="false">
        <include model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

In this case, all the default configs associated with the *model1* will be included into the installation.
