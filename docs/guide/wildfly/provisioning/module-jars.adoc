#### Thin servers vs local module JARs

By default, the plug-in will resolve Maven module artifacts and copy the JARs to the target installation.

However, the plug-in checks system property *wfThinServer* and if it is present and its value is empty or true, the resulting installation will not include the module JARs but will reference the corresponding Maven artifacts instead from the modules' *module.xml* files.

The system property has to be set either on the command line launching the PM tool, e.g.

[options="nowrap"]
 pm -DwfThinServer <other arguments>

or from a Java client using the PM public API.
