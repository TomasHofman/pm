### WildFly PM Provisioning Plug-in

This chapter describes the WildFly provisioning plug-in which is included into feature-packs of WildFly-based distributions.

The plug-in is called by the PM tool after the feature-pack and package dependencies have been resolved and the content from packages has been copied to the target installation directory.

The WildFly provisioning plug-in is then responsible for:

** <<config-gen,generating the configuration file(s) based on the installed package set (possibly customized by the user)>>;

** <<module-jars,building "thin" servers (i.e. servers with module.xml files referencing module JARs as Maven artifacts) or copying module JARs into the target installation>>;

** <<wildfly-tasks-xml,performing other tasks configured in wildlfy-tasks.xml>>.
