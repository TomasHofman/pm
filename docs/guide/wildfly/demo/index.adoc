### Demo

This chapter describes how to try the tool provisioning WildFly Core, Servlet and Full distributions and their customized versions.

NOTE: Please, just keep in mind, there hasn't been even an Alpha release, it's not perfect. This chapter is here for people interested in following the evolution of the tool and communicating their requirements. Please direct your questions or feedback to mailto:olubyans@redhat.com[the developer]. Thanks!

#### The tool

The tool can be downloaded from https://github.com/aloubyansky/pm/tree/demo[here] and then built using
[options="nowrap"]
 mvn clean install

There is also `./do.sh` script for convenience in the root directory of the project which, if launched w/o arguments, will build the project and launch the tool's command-line interface.
The command-line interface can also be launched w/o re-building the project by
[options="nowrap"]
 ./do.sh run

The CLI session can be terminated by executing command `exit` or simply pressing `Ctrl-C`.

#### WildFly Core

The branch of WildFly Core that uses the Maven plug-in from the provisioning tool to build the new feature-packs (along with the currently actually in-use ones) and install them into the local Maven repo is https://github.com/aloubyansky/wildfly-core/tree/new-feature-pack-demo[here].

Check it out and build WildFly Core using
[options="nowrap"]
 mvn clean install -DskipTests

to install the new provisioning feature-packs into your local Maven repository.

NOTE: skipping the tests is suggested only to save your time, there aren't any expected failures.

#### WildFly Servlet and Full

Servlet and Full feature-packs are produced by the same build process in https://github.com/aloubyansky/wildfly/tree/new-feature-pack-demo[this branch].

Check it out and build the project using
[options="nowrap"]
 mvn clean install -DskipTests

to install WildFly Servlet and Full feature-packs into your local Maven repository.

#### Installing Core, Servlet and Full distributions

Once you've downloaded and built the tool and then the `wfcore` and `wildfly` projects, have the feature-packs installed into your local repositories, you can try using the tool to actually install the projects at a specific location.

Here is how you can install the core:

[options="nowrap"]
 ./do.sh run
 [pm]$ install org.wildfly.core:wildfly-core-feature-pack-new:3.0.0.Beta29-SNAPSHOT --dir=<installation-home>

NOTE: Tab-completion should work for the feature-pack coords.

Prompt `[pm]$` indicates that the current file-system directory is `pm`.

`--dir` argument is optional, if it is not present, the current file-system directory will be used as the installation home directory.

Servlet and Full distributions can be installed with the same command but using the corresponding feature-pack coordinates, i.e.

 * `org.wildfly:wildfly-servlet-feature-pack-new:11.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` for the Servlet distribution;
 * `org.wildfly:wildfly-feature-pack-new:11.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` for the Full distribution.

NOTE: Since Full feature-pack depends on Servlet feature-pack and Servlet feature-pack depends on Core feature-pack, installing Full feature-pack will implicitly install Servlet and Core feature-packs.

#### Uninstalling a feature-pack

Using the Core as an example:

[options="nowrap"]
 [pm]$ uninstall org.wildfly.core:wildfly-core-feature-pack-new:3.0.0.Beta29-SNAPSHOT --dir=<installation-home>

#### Exporting Current Provisioning Specification

[options="nowrap"]
 [pm]$ cd <installation-home>
 [<installation-home>]$ provisioned-spec export <work-dir>

`<work-dir>` will contain `provisioning.xml` which is the current provisioning specification of the installation.

#### Provisioning specific default configuration

Installing any of the feature-packs will produce an installation that is equivalent to our default build or release, meaning it will contain all the modules, standalone and domain configurations.

Each feature-pack has a package called `dist.standalone`. If this package is selected, it will pull the modules and configuration necessary to run the standalone server. Here is how a user can install only the standalone server:

1) Export the `provisioning.xml` from the default installation to use as a config template.

2) Modfiy the feature-pack config (let's use Core as an example) to

[options="nowrap"]
    <feature-pack groupId="org.wildfly.core" artifactId="wildfly-core-feature-pack-new" version="3.0.0.Beta29-SNAPSHOT">
        <packages inherit="false">
            <include name="dist.standalone"/>
        </packages>
    </feature-pack>

3) From the provisioning CLI execute
[options="nowrap"]
 provision-spec <work-dir>/provisioning.xml --dir=<installation-home>

What you've done is excluded all the packages installed by default from the specified feature-pack and included only `dist.standalone` and its dependencies that are installed implicitly.
You can do the same exercise for `dist.domain` package.

Complete list of the default (pre-defined) distributions that can be installed in this way for Core feature-pack is:

 * dist.standalone
 * dist.domain
 * dist.legacy (combines the packages above)

for Servlet feature-pack:

 * dist.standalone
 * dist.load-balancer
 * dist.domain
 * dist.legacy (combines the packages above)

for Full feature-pack:

 * dist.domain
 * dist.domain-full
 * dist.domain-full-ha
 * dist.domain-ha
 * dist.domain-load-balancer
 * dist.standalone
 * dist.standalone-full
 * dist.standalone-full-ha
 * dist.standalone-ha
 * dist.legacy (combines the packages above)

You can try customizing the installation further by including and/or excluding specific packages that represent modules and subsystems in the same way.
